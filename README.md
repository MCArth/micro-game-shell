# micro-game-shell

A small game shell. Provides reliable timing events, and manages pointerlock/fullscreen/resize.

[Live demo](https://andyhall.github.io/micro-game-shell/)

This library provides two sets of timing events: `tick`, which can fire at any specified rate, and `render`, which fire as often as the browser redraws (but can be throttled to a lower rate).`

The intention is that game clients can use these events to implement 
[fixed timesteps](https://gafferongames.com/post/fix_your_timestep/), where game logic (e.g. physics) runs at a different cadence than rendering.

## Usage

```sh
npm i --save micro-game-shell
```

```js
import { MicroGameShell } from '..'
var $ = document.querySelector.bind(document)

var domElement = $('.game-container')   // optional
var pollRate = 10                       // optional, default 10ms
var shell = new MicroGameShell(domElement, pollRate)

shell.tickRate = 30               // ticks/second
shell.maxRenderRate = 0           // 0 means uncapped
shell.stickyPointerLock = true    // requests pointerLock on click
shell.stickyFullscreen = false    // ditto for fullscreen
```


## API

Settings:

 * `tickRate` - tick events per second. Default `30`
 * `maxRenderRate` - upper limit for the rate of render events. Default of `0` means uncapped.
 * `stickyPointerLock` - shell will request pointerLock when the domElement is clicked. default `false`
 * `stickyFullscreen` - shell will request fullscreen when the domElement is clicked. default `false`

Properties:

 * `pointerLock` - manage whether the DOM element has pointerlock
 * `fullscreen` - manage whether the DOM element has fullscreen

Events:

 * `onTick(dt)` - tick event handler. `dt` is a fixed constant value (in ms), not the actual time elapsed.
 * `onRender(dt, framePart)` - render event handler. `dt` is actual time since the last render (in ms), and `framepart` is the fractional number of game ticks that have elapsed since the last tick. Note that if you're doing fixed timesteps correctly, you should find the latter argument more useful than the first.

 * `onInit()` - fires once, when shell is set up (after `DOMReady` if necessary)
 * `onResize()` - fires when dom element changes size
 * `onPointerLockChanged(hasPL)` - fires on gaining/losing pointerLock
 * `onFullscreenChanged(hasFS)` - fires on gaining/losing fullscreen
